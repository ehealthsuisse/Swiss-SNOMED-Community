# Swiss Snomed-Community
## What is the SNOMED-Community?

This platform is designed not only to facilitate exchanges between SNOMED users but also as a platform for support. It should enable users to support each other on questions concerning implementation and also for general questions on SNOMED CT. As this platform – and participation intensity – will develop over time, users are encouraged to submit suggestions as to how it could be improved. For the platform can only be successful if it meets users’ needs.

## How is the Swiss SNOMED Community site structured?
Altogether there are three repositories, which are interlinked. In the Swiss SNOMED [community](https://github.com/ehealthsuisse/Community/blob/main/README.md) repository, you will find thematically grouped  [discussions](https://github.com/ehealthsuisse/Community/discussions) and a section on Netiquette. Under officail [Announcements](https://github.com/ehealthsuisse/Announcements/discussions), Snomed CT news is published. The [Archive](https://github.com/ehealthsuisse/Archiv/discussions) contains questions which have already been answered, contributions to discussions and archived information.

### Community
The “Community” repository comprises the Netiquette section and a Discussions forum with links to various thematic areas. The “General” section is designed for the discussion of general topics relating to SNOMED CT. Under “Q&A”, both technical and also more general questions about SNOMED CT can be asked and answered. Once a question has been answered, its status can be changed to “answered”, preferably by the person who asked the question. Under “Ideas”, ideas can be posted concerning implementation and more generally about the use of SNOMED CT. Under “Show and Tell”, general projects, implementations or other SNOMED CT related topics can be posted.

### Announcements
The “Announcements” repository contains news and announcements concerning SNOMED CT. If a meeting is desired for a particular SNOMED CT, this can be organised within the Community. This may be helpful, for example, if a number of users have the same problem or the same question. Here, active participation is encouraged.
### Archive
In the “Archive” repository, Community discussions are archived. Before asking a question or opening a discussion, it is recommended that users check this repository to see whether the topic or question has already been discussed or answered.
