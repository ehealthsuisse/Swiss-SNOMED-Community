## Netiquette

Before we begin, let's review the communication rules:
•	Write and behave in the discussion as if the person you are addressing was standing right in front of you. 
•	Since you wouldn't pass on your work documents to a complete stranger,  don't share them here. This way, you will avoid copyright infringement. 
•	In the same logic, don’t publish your personal data (telephone number, address, email address, etc.) or that of others. 
•	Users treat each other respectfully and remain objective and polite. 
•	Since we want a serious and meaningful discussion, we label the quotes and check our sources.
