## Netiquette

Before we begin, let's review the rules of communication. Write in the discussion as if the person you are addressing is standing right in front of you. Conduct yourself as though you were talking to the user face-to-face. This way, you also avoid infringing on copyright. You wouldn't show your work documents to a complete stranger, so don't share them here. Just as you would not publish your personal data (telephone number, address, email address, etc.) or that of others. We do not tolerate bullying or advertising on this platform. Users treat each other with respect and remain objective and polite. As we want a high-quality discussion, we mark quotations and check our sources.
